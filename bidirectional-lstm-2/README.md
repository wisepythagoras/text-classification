# Classification using LSTM

In this example I'm using a bidirectional LSTM and a [GRU](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/GRU?hl=en) (gated recurrent unit) and an additional Dense layer. I've tweaked the batch size, learning rate, and some more things and ensure that the validation accuracy is increasing consistently.
